ChatGPT has taken over the world and has declared that only intelligent humans shall remain. 
To determine who will live, ChatGPT has created a little game.


The computer will randomly choose a number between 1 and 100

The user will then enter a number and the computer will say 'Cold' if it's less than the target number or 'Hot' if it's greater than.

The user will then keep entering numbers until they guess the target number

The computer will say "colder" if they get further away or "warmer" if they get closer.

The game ends when the user has guessed the correct number or they have exceeded 10 guesses.

Example:
    Input:
    5
    6
    7
    8

    Output:
    Cold
    Warmer
    Warmer
    Warmer
    "You guessed the right number"
