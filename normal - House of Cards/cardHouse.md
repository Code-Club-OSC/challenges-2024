A house has N stories, where N is a whole number.

Each story is made out of struts, which may be supported by platforms.

The top story has 2 struts and 1 platform.
The second-to-top story has 4 struts and 2 platforms.
The third-to-top story has 6 struts and 3 platforms.
In general, each story has 2 more struts and 1 more platform than the story above it.

Note that the bottom story does not have a platform, because the table is already supporting it.
